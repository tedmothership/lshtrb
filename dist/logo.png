// CRITICAL:
    // 1. Ensure you have DELETED any old `logo.png` from this `public` directory.
    // 2. RE-DOWNLOAD the logo image from: https://i.ibb.co/LdqG7T7L/lushtubate-logo.png
    // 3. Save the newly downloaded image DIRECTLY into this `public` folder.
    // 4. Name the file EXACTLY `logo.png` (all lowercase).
    // 5. After doing this, RE-DEPLOY your application.
    //
    // This file is a placeholder for the actual binary image.
    // The problem you are experiencing is because the browser cannot find or load
    // `lushturbate.com/logo.png`. This means the image file was not correctly
    // deployed to the server at the root of your site's assets.
